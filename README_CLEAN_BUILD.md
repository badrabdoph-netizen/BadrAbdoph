# Clean build (Railway-friendly)

This package is a cleaned version of the project with **heavy images removed/replaced** by tiny placeholders.
Paths and filenames are kept the same so the website runs without code changes.

## What changed
- Replaced 14 files inside `client/public/images/` with tiny placeholders.
- Removed any video files in `client/public/`.

## Next
You can later upload your real images back into `client/public/images/` (same filenames) and push to GitHub.
